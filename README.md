# üöÄ Spring Boot Bootcamp Exercises

Welcome to the **Spring Boot Bootcamp Exercises** repository! This repo contains my daily Java and Spring Boot projects as part of my learning journey. Each day is organized as a standalone project/folder for easy navigation and execution.

---

## üìö Project Overview

This repository is a collection of hands-on exercises and mini-projects completed during my Spring Boot bootcamp. Each folder under the root directory represents a separate day's work, ranging from basic Java programs to full-fledged Spring Boot applications.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

```
spring-boot-bootcamp/
  day-01/
    src/
    pom.xml (if Spring Boot)
    ...
  day-02/
    src/
    ...
  ...
```

- **Each `day-XX/` folder** is a self-contained Java or Spring Boot project.
- **`src/`** contains the source code for that day's exercises.
- **`pom.xml` or `build.gradle`** (if present) means it's a Spring Boot project.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Each Day's Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fkhrayef/spring-boot-bootcamp.git
   cd spring-boot-bootcamp
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired day:**
   ```sh
   cd day-02
   ```
3. **Run the project:**
   - For plain Java:
     - Open in your IDE and run the main class, or
     - Compile and run with:
       ```sh
       javac src/*.java
       java -cp src MainClassName
       ```
   - For Spring Boot:
     - With Maven:
       ```sh
       mvn spring-boot:run
